# Project Title

This is a web app as part of the project for the product design course (Yves Bellouard at EPFL).
This web app shall receive data from "Smart" trash bins, process it and provide some visualisations and predictions, in order to help EPFL cleaners.
We use Django for the back-end (Server side of the app), which is a python framework for developping web apps, and Bootstrap for the front-end (client side), which is good for handling screens with different formats (responsive design).
